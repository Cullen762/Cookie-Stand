         One rainy day Pat got totally baked on hindu kush and really wanted some smoked salmon and crackers. He had the salmon but no crackers, he decided to just you know make crackers. After three hours of thinking about it, he got up and went into the kitchen, The simpsons were on, it was raining, somehow he made salmon short bread cookies instead. The rest is history. We have no idea who these people are.
