         One rainy day Pat got totally baked on hindu kush and really wanted some smoked salmon and crackers. He had the salmon but no crackers, he decided to just crackers. He was really backed and ended up making shortbread with smoked salmon. The simpsons were on, it was raining, it was a good day. The rest is history.We have no idea who these people are.
