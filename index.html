  <p><strong>Our Story</strong>
    A Seattle native, Pat loves: food, coffee, craft beer and passive agressive driving. One rainy day Pat got totally baked on edibles and decided that smoked salmon on short bread cookies would be the bomb. So he took finely ground salmon, combined it with flour, sugar and local artisinal butter. The end result was a smokey sweet cookie. The rest is history.

<p><strong>Fish cookies....really?</strong>
Really! the amalgamation of sweet and savory is not new to the PNW. In fact First Nations -link-and Native Americans have been making "fish candy" -link-for as long as sasquatch has been eating lone hikers. Our most popluar flavors are the smoked shortbread and tamari cookies. Who says cookies cant be savory?
</p>
<p>Our fish cookies are not only delicsious they are healthy as well. The addition of fish provides loads of vitamin D to get through those rainy days and they are packed full of protien. </p>
